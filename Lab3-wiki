References page

This page should be an updated set of references that your team has maintained throughout CS 410 and CS 411W.

Glossary & Definitions page

This is an updated version of the list of terms your team has maintained through CS 410 and CS 411W.

Table of Contents page (or section).

This can either be its own page, or a section on the home page.

Collection of Process, Interface, and Task pages.

Instructions and figures must be divided up into sections (and pages) based on functionality (e.g., how to log in, how to add a contact, how to not download more RAM).

Your team has a fair amount of latitude in how the pages or organized or divided. However, this latitude must be combined with careful discussion and planning.

For Lab 3… these sections and pages need to be identified. The content itself will be added as parts of your team’s Prototype are finalized.
